        "text body": "Founded in 1951, Peak District National Park was the first established national park in the UK. The park is spread throughout five counties, including Derbyshire, Cheshire, Staffordshire, Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. The 555-square-mile park hosts over 13 million visitors per year and is home to 38,000 residents.\n\nThe Peak District is divided into the White Peak and the Dark Peak, with the White Peak characterised by limestone formations, forming stunning glacial dales and the Dark Peak being known for its dramatic gritstone edges, rougher terrain, and wild moorlands. Together, they form a diverse landscape, offering a wide range of routes, whether you’re looking for a leisurely riverside stroll or a more challenging hike along the gritstone ridges.\n\nKinder Scout is the highest point in the Peak District, a large plateau in the Dark Peak. This area also holds historical significance. In 1932, the Mass Trespass took place on this moorland plateau. This mass protest involved over 400 people defying the law that prohibited walking across the land. This event fuelled the right-to-roam movement, which led to establishing national parks throughout the United Kingdom, with the Peak District being the first. There are many approaches to Kinder Scout, with some of the most popular ones starting from the village of Edale.\n\nNear Kinder Scout, across the valley, you’ll find one of the most iconic hills in England, Mam Tor, also known as the Shivering Mountain. Located on the Great Ridge, there are a variety of routes over its undulating spine which extends all the way to Lose Hill. Mam Tor translates to Mother Hill, which is so named because of the small hills surrounding it, formed by landslides. It is also known as the Shivering Mountain because of these landslides. In this area, you’ll also find four show caves to explore, some used to mine the rare Blue John stones.\n\nThere are several impressive gritstone edges to explore in the Dark Peak, such as Bamford Edge, Derwent Edge, and Stanage Edge, which overlook the valley and provide excellent climbing routes and bouldering opportunities. For photography enthusiasts, the evening hours provide the most enchanting light as the sun begins its descent, casting a warm glow upon the edges.\n\nThe Roaches is another gritstone edge towards the park's southern end, extending across the South Pennine Moors. On its northern slope, you’ll find Lud’s Church within the Forest Wood, a deep fissure through the Millstone Grit bedrock that was created by a massive landslip that has been linked to the Arthurian Legend of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\n\nWhile Peak District National Park is not home to any mountains (Kinder Scout is the highest point at 636 meters), it does boast interesting geology and features several fascinating caves to explore. The deepest is over 400 meters below the ground, and people still lived in the caves until 1910. Another iconic cave can be found near the village of Wetton, Thor’s Cave, a natural cavern set in a steep limestone crag above the Manifold Valley. Evidence suggests that humans have inhabited the cave for thousands of years, with archaeological finds dating back to the Paleolithic era.\n\nNumerous reservoirs are interspersed throughout the landscape, including the Y-shaped Ladybower, with its adjacent reservoirs Derwent and Howden Reservoirs, where the Dambuster Raid in the Second World War used to be practised. The construction of the reservoir required flooding the village of Derwent and Ashopton. Some town remnants can still be seen when the water level is dramatically low.\n\nAt the western end of the Peak District lies Macclesfield Forest, the last remnant of the extensive Royal Forest, created by the Normans as a hunting reserve.\n\nExplore the nature reserves and walk along the winding rivers, visiting the stepping stones of Dovedale National Nature Reserve, the almost vertical limestone sides of Wolfscote Dale, and the deep gorge of Chee Dale.\n\nParticularly in the southern part, railway paths traverse the Peak District, including the Manifold Way, the Tissington Trail, and the Monsal Trail, all of which follow old railway lines and offer excellent opportunities for walking, running, horse riding, and cycling.\n\nInterwoven with the landscape are various legends and folktales, adding an air of mystery to the caves, dales and hills, from a vicious mermaid in Doxey Pool in the Roaches to a mischievous sprite that dwells in Thor’s Cave and undulating ridges resembling sleeping dragons.",

On its northern slope, you’ll find Lud’s Church within the Forest Wood, a deep fissure through the Millstone Grit bedrock that was created by a massive landslip that has been linked to the Arthurian Legend of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\n\nWhile Peak District National Park is not home to any mountains (Kinder Scout is the highest point at 636 meters), it does boast interesting geology and features several fascinating caves to explore. The deepest is over 400 meters below the ground, and people still lived in the caves until 1910. Another iconic cave can be found near the village of Wetton, Thor’s Cave, a natural cavern set in a steep limestone crag above the Manifold Valley. Evidence suggests that humans have inhabited the cave for thousands of years, with archaeological finds dating back to the Paleolithic era.\n\nNumerous reservoirs are interspersed throughout the landscape, including the Y-shaped Ladybower, with its adjacent reservoirs Derwent and Howden Reservoirs, where the Dambuster Raid in the Second World War used to be practised. The construction of the reservoir required flooding the village of Derwent and Ashopton. Some town remnants can still be seen when the water level is dramatically low.\n\nAt the western end of the Peak District lies Macclesfield Forest, the last remnant of the extensive Royal Forest, created by the Normans as a hunting reserve.\n\nExplore the nature reserves and walk along the winding rivers, visiting the stepping stones of Dovedale National Nature Reserve, the almost vertical limestone sides of Wolfscote Dale, and the deep gorge of Chee Dale.\n\nParticularly in the southern part, railway paths traverse the Peak District, including the Manifold Way, the Tissington Trail, and the Monsal Trail, all of which follow old railway lines and offer excellent opportunities for walking, running, horse riding, and cycling.\n\nInterwoven with the landscape are various legends and folktales, adding an air of mystery to the caves, dales and hills, from a vicious mermaid in Doxey Pool in the Roaches to a mischievous sprite that dwells in Thor’s Cave and undulating ridges resembling sleeping dragons.",
